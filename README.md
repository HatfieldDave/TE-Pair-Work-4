# Week 7 Pair Project

The goal of this assignment is to practice consuming APIs by testing in Postman and using RestSharp to make REST requests.

## Step 1: Pick an API to interact with

Some tips on picking APIs:

- Avoid anything that requires authentication or any sort of auth / API tokens
    - If you have to create an account, it's not a good pick
- Try to pick an API that doesn't require a complex object in the request body
- Try to pick an API that doesn't send back a complex object in the response body
- Look for APIs with beginner-friendly documentation
    - If the documentation is lacking, your instructors are unlikely to make additional sense of an API they didn't create
- Pick something of interest to _both_ partners. 
    - Remember: both of you are paying for an education and are valuable people. 
    - Teams will reject technically excellent candidates if they feel they will not put the team first

**Once you have selected an API, send your instructor(s) a link to that API via Slack for approval and move on to the next step.** Instructors will look over the selected API within business hours and will warn you if it appears to not be feasible with what you know.

## Step 2: Make a Successful REST Request to that API in Postman

_Before starting: Make sure you have completed step 1._

Using Postman, make a successful REST request to the endpoint you selected and verify that the proper response body and status code comes back.

The response body is something you will use in the next step to build a C# model around.

**When you have one or more API calls that succeed in Postman, take a screenshot and save it in your pair project directory, then proceed to the next step.**

## Step 3: Create the Models needed in your C# project's "Models" directory



## Step 4: Make a REST Request to the target API with Rest Sharp

## Step 5: Display information about the result to the user
